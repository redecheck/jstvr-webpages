 <p>So close! Next up, our team will create a launch plan to archive the current website (if needed) and release the new website to the public, as well as a quality checklist to ensure that all project requirements are met. Weâ€™ll make sure that the new website is submitted to the appropriate search engines, and that web analytics are installed and configured. We'll also work with our smarty-pants friend at the Status Bureau to make sure you understand how to access and act on web analytics reports.</p>
